# Clustering data based on sentence vectors

# Task:
Clustering customer support data based on similar sentences for the creation of a chatbot.

# Method
- Data preprocessing: SpaCy + DataPurifier + Stanza
- Sentence vectorizing algorithms: Sentence Bert vs. Word2Vec
- Clustering algorithm: Kmeans

# Other helpful algorithms
Another useful algorithm that was not used in this project is LDA, or Latent Dirichlet Allocation. This is a topic modelling algorithm that is widely used with good results. A topic according to this algorithm is a selection of dominant keywords that are related. Together these key words form a topic. LDA find the distribution of each topic in a document, and also calculate the proportion of each topic in relation to each other. In this way, the dominant topic + keywords can be found in each document, and over a collection of documents.
